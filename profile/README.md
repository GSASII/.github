GSAS-II is a unique and comprehensive open source Python project for determination of crystal structures and diffraction-based materials characterization for crystalline solids on all scales, from perovskites through proteins, using both powder and single-crystal diffraction and with both x-ray and neutron probes. Refinements can combine measurements from laboratory and synchrotron x-rays as well as constant wavelength or time-of-flight* neutron sources. It provides structure solution and refinement as well as extensive visualization capabilities.

The GSASII organization is being used for testing out git integration. The repositories here are expected to be transitory and their use is not recommended. Copies of repositories intended for public use will eventually be placed here: https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource. We are in the process of migrating the primary repository from svn to git, until this is complete, a manually-mirrored copy of the svn repository can be found here: https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSASII-copy. This copy may not always have the latest changes checked into svn, but will always match a recent release. Branches may be used to try out different PRs prior to the code update into svn.

* At present the home page for the software is here: https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/pyGSAS
* The main svn repository for the source code is: https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/pyGSAS, but can be browsed here: https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/pyGSAS/browser
