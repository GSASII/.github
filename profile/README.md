GSAS-II is a unique and comprehensive open source Python project for determination of crystal structures and diffraction-based materials characterization for crystalline solids on all scales, from perovskites through proteins, using both powder and single-crystal diffraction and with both x-ray and neutron probes. Refinements can combine measurements from laboratory and synchrotron x-rays as well as constant wavelength or time-of-flight* neutron sources. It provides structure solution and refinement as well as extensive visualization capabilities.

This GSASII organization was originally created for testing out git integration, but those repositories have been deleted. The repositories intended for public use are: 
+ https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II
  + (main code repository)
+ https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II-tutorials
  + (to view documentation, use https://GSASII.github.io or https://advancedphotonsource.github.io/GSAS-II-tutorials/)
+ https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II-buildtools
  + (location of installation kits & build scripts)

GSAS-II also exists on an subversion repository at Argonne, but this will be deactivated soon. 

* At present the home page for the software is here: https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/pyGSAS
* The main svn repository for the source code is: https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/pyGSAS, but can be browsed here: https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/pyGSAS/browser
