GSAS-II is a unique and comprehensive open source Python project for determination of crystal structures and diffraction-based materials characterization for crystalline solids on all scales, from perovskites through proteins, using both powder and single-crystal diffraction and with both x-ray and neutron probes. Refinements can combine measurements from laboratory and synchrotron x-rays as well as constant wavelength or time-of-flight* neutron sources. It provides structure solution and refinement as well as extensive visualization capabilities.

* At present the home page for the software is here: https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/pyGSAS
* The source code is maintained here: https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/pyGSAS, but can be browsed here: https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/trac/pyGSAS/browser
* A mirrored version of the svn repository is provided in github for code developers who wish to use the features like pull requests and the issues tracker. It is found here: https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSASII-copy. The master GitHub version may not always have the latest changes checked into svn, but will always match a recent release. Branches may be used to try out different PRs prior to the code update into svn.
